# 📱 Living Lexicon – Functionalities Walkthrough

The **Basic Form prototype** for Living Lexicon was developed for Android devices using the following technologies:

- **Python (Kivy framework)**
- **SQLite** for local database management
- **Web scraping** using BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries to retrieve definitions

## 🔍 1. Search Words

- Enter a word on the search screen to fetch definitions and parts of speech from the web.  
  - Press the button with the search icon or hit Enter.  
- The searched word and its definitions are automatically saved to a local database.  
  - If the word had been searched previously, definitions are fetched from the local database instead of the web.

  ### • Compressed View

  ### • Flashcard View

  ### • By Search Date (Newest → Oldest, Oldest → Newest)  
  ### • By Search Frequency (Most → Least, Least → Most)  
  ### • Frequency appears as a numerical label to the left of each word
