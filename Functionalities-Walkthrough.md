## Functionalities

### 1. Search Words
- Enter a word on the search screen to fetch definitions and parts of speech from the web.  
  - Press the button with the search icon or hit Enter.  
- The searched word and its definitions are automatically saved to a local database.  
  - If the word had been searched previously, definitions are fetched from the local database instead of the web.
