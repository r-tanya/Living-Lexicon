# Future Developments

The app's prototype version lays the foundation for an interactive dictionary experience. Future versions may refine and expand on these key areas:

1. **Core expansion: personalized vocabulary lists**
   - Organize saved words into categories or “lessons” related to work, school, interests, media titles, etc. (e.g., Chemistry, Geography, Cooking)
   - Drag and drop words into different lists
   - Visual indicators showing which words belong to which categories
   - Custom order lessons and words within them
   - Quick-add option to save searches directly to a chosen list

3. Enhanced visuals
  • List view: Collapsible sections (e.g., hide/show words under each letter)
  • Flashcard view:
    o Horizontal flip animation
    o “Flip all” option
    o Lined paper design on definition side
    o Swipe sideways to preview parts of definition

4. Improved learning experience
  • Quickly generate review lists for recently added words (e.g., past day, week, month, or five most recent words)
  • Create randomized word lists with a set number of words
  • Move mastered words into an “already learned” category to de-clutter active lists
  • Toggle on/off whether searched words are automatically committed to My Dictionary
  • Sort lists by shuffling them
  • Flexible definition navigation:
    o In list view, scroll up and down to cycle through multiple definitions or expand to view all
    o In flashcard view, swipe through multiple definitions for a word or set a preferred one to display

5. Expanded functionality
  • Export/copy/print dictionary as a list
  • Search within saved words
  • Example sentences for each definition (sourced from integrated dictionaries, dynamic web retrieval, or manual user input)
  • Expanded entries: Support for phrases, idioms, and expressions
  • Word management: Delete words individually or in bulk

6. Account system and sharing features
  • User login: Create accounts to sync words across devices
  • Community learning: Allow users to share specialized word lists—e.g., a teacher sharing curated lists with students—based on subjects, interests, or classes

7. Advanced features for long-term expansion
  • Aesthetic options: Themes, dark mode
  • Integration: Save words directly from eBooks, web articles, and apps
  • Multilingual support: Define English words in different languages and allow switching between language modes
  • Voice features: Word pronunciation playback and voice search
  • Statistics and insights: Visual graphs showing vocabulary growth, category usage, search trends, and learning streaks
  • AI-powered enhancements:
    o AI-generated example sentences
    o Word predictions while typing
    o Category detection and tagging — Suggest categories for newly added words and automatically organize words by topic
    o Smart word suggestions — Recommend related words to add to categories
