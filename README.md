## Living-Lexicon
A personalized vocabulary-learning app with multiple display modes and sorting options.

### Overview
Do you ever come across an unfamiliar word, look up its definition, and then forget it when it comes up again? What if you could create a custom dictionary—a way to store and track the words that keep cropping up across your life, work, and hobbies? Living Lexicon is an app that makes discovering, saving, and reviewing words a simple and natural task. This tool helps you stay on top of your vocabulary learning and dynamically expand your personal lexicon. While standard dictionary apps stop at definitions, this app helps users save words, track their usage, and revisit them through flashcards and history—like having a personal vocabulary notebook.

### Who is it for?
- Readers who look up words often and want to remember them.
- Writers keeping track of striking and/or unfamiliar words.
- Language learners building vocabulary in context.
- Students studying for exams or building glossaries.

### Technologies Used
The prototype for Living Lexicon was developed using the following:
- Python (Kivy framework)
- SQLite for local database management
- Web scraping using BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries to retrieve definitions
