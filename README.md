# Living-Lexicon

A personalized vocabulary-learning app with multiple display modes and sorting options.

## Overview
Do you ever come across an unfamiliar word, look up its definition, and then forget it when it comes up again? What if you could create a custom dictionary—a way to store and track the words that keep cropping up across your life, work, and hobbies? Living Lexicon helps you stay on top of your vocabulary learning and dynamically expand your personal lexicon. While standard dictionary apps stop at definitions, this app helps users save words, track their usage, and revisit them through flashcards and history—like having a personal vocabulary notebook.
