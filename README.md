# Living-Lexicon
A personalized vocabulary-learning app with multiple display modes and sorting options.

### Introduction
Do you ever come across an unfamiliar word, look up its definition, and then forget it when it comes up again? What if you could create a custom dictionaryâ€”a way to store and track the words that keep cropping up across your life, work, and hobbies? 

Living Lexicon makes defining, saving, and reviewing words a simple and natural task. This tool helps users stay on top of their vocabulary learning and dynamically expand their personal dictionary.

### Target Audience
- Readers who look up words often and want to remember them.
- Writers keeping track of striking/unfamiliar words.
- Language learners building vocabulary.
- Students studying for exams.

### Technologies Used
The prototype for Living Lexicon was developed using the following:
- Python (Kivy framework)
- SQLite for local database management
- Web scraping using BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries to retrieve definitions
